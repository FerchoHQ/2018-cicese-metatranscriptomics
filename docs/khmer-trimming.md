# K-mer Error Trimming

(Optional)

khmer documentation: http://khmer.readthedocs.io/en/latest

## Why (or why not) do k-mer trimming?

If you can assemble your data set without k-mer trimming, there's no
reason to do it.  The reason we're error trimming here is to speed up
the assembler (by removing data) and to decrease the memory requirements
of the assembler (by removing a number of k-mers).

## Set up workspace and install khmer 

```
conda install khmer
```

To run error trimming, use the khmer script `trim-low-abund.py`:

```
cd ${PROJECT}/trim

for filename in *_1.qc.fq.gz
do
# first, make the base by removing fastq
  baseR1=$(basename $filename .qc.fq.gz)
  echo $baseR1

# now, construct the R2 filename by replacing R1 with R2
  baseR2=${baseR1/1m_1/1m_2}
  echo $baseR2

# construct a shared basename for the interleaved file:
  base=${baseR1/1m_1/1m}
  echo $base

# finally, run khmer trimming
  interleave-reads.py ${baseR1}.qc.fq.gz ${baseR2}.qc.fq.gz | \
  trim-low-abund.py --gzip -V -M 8e9 -C 3 -Z 10 - -o ${base}.khmer.fq 

done
```

## Assess changes in kmer abundance

To see how many k-mers we removed, you can examine the distribution as above,
or use the `unique-kmers.py` script. Let's compare kmers for one sample.

```
unique-kmers.py TARA_135_SRF_5-20_rep1_1m_1.qc.fq.gz TARA_135_SRF_5-20_rep1_1m_2.qc.fq.gz
unique-kmers.py TARA_135_SRF_5-20_rep1_1m.khmer.fq.gz
```

### Better walk-through and explanation from 2017 cicese workshop (edit & add if time)

Let's plot a kmer abundance histogram of one sample
```
cd $PROJECT
abundance-dist-single.py -M 1e9 -k 21 SRR1976948_1.fastq.gz SRR1976948_1.fastq.gz.dist

```

If you plot a k-mer abundance histogram of the samples, you'll
notice something: there's an awful lot of unique (abundance=1) k-mers.
These are erroneous k-mers caused by sequencing errors.



and in another cell::

  %matplotlib inline
  import numpy
  from pylab import *
  dist1 = numpy.loadtxt('SRR1976948_1.fastq.gz.dist', skiprows=1, delimiter=',')
  plot(dist1[:,0], dist1[:,1])
  axis(xmax=50)

Many of these errors remain even after you do the Trimmomatic run; you can
see this with::

  !abundance-dist-single.py -M 1e9 -k 21 SRR1976948_1.qc.fq.gz SRR1976948_1.qc.fq.gz.dist

and then plot::

  dist2 = numpy.loadtxt('SRR1976948_1.qc.fq.gz.dist', skiprows=1, delimiter=',')
  plot(dist1[:,0], dist1[:,1], label='untrimmed')
  plot(dist2[:,0], dist2[:,1], label='trimmed')
  legend(loc='upper right')
  axis(xmax=50)

This is for
two reasons:

First, Trimmomatic trims based solely on the quality score, which is
a statistical statement about the correctness of a base - a Q score
of 30 means that, of 1000 bases with that Q score, 1 of those
bases will be wrong.  So, a base can have a high Q score and still
be wrong! (and **many** bases will have a low Q score and still be
correct)

Second, we trimmed **very** lightly - only bases that had a very low
quality were removed.  This was intentional because with assembly,
you want to retain as much coverage as possible, and the assembler
will generally figure out what the "correct" base is from the coverage.

An alternative to trimming based on the quality scores is to trim based on
k-mer abundance - this is known as k-mer spectral error trimming.  K-mer
spectral error trimming *always* beats quality score trimming in terms
of eliminating errors; e.g. look at this table from `Zhang et al., 2014 <http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0101271>`__:

   :width: 40%

The basic logic is this: if you see low abundance k-mers in a high
coverage data set, those k-mers are almost certainly the result of
errors.  (Caveat: strain variation could also create them.)

In metagenomic data sets we do have the problem that we may have very
low and very high coverage data.  So we don't necessarily want to get
rid of all low-abundance k-mers, because they may represent truly low
abundance (but useful) data.

As part of the khmer project in my lab, we have developed an approach
that sorts reads into high abundance and low abundance reads, and only
error trims the high abundance reads.

   :width: 40%

This does mean that many errors may get left in the data set, because we
have no way of figuring out if they are errors or simply low coverage,
but that's OK (and you can always trim them off if you really care).

.. Error profile@@

To run such error trimming, use the command ``trim-low-abund.py``
(at the command line, or prefix with a '!' in the notebook)::

  interleave-reads.py SRR1976948_1.qc.fq.gz SRR1976948_2.qc.fq.gz |
     trim-low-abund.py -V -M 8e9 -C 3 -Z 10 - -o SRR1976948.trim.fq

Why (or why not) do k-mer trimming?
-----------------------------------

If you can assemble your data set without k-mer trimming, there's no
reason to do it.  The reason we're error trimming here is to speed up
the assembler (by removing data) and to decrease the memory requirements
of the assembler (by removing a number of k-mers).

To see how many k-mers we removed, you can examine the distribution as above,
or use the ``unique-kmers.py`` script::

    unique-kmers.py SRR1976948_1.qc.fq.gz SRR1976948_2.qc.fq.gz
    unique-kmers.py SRR1976948.trim.fq
